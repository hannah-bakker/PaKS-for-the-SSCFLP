# Results

## Overview

In this folder, **results** generated by running the algorithms in `scripts/main.py` are stored.

An exemplary output file for instance `i300_1` solved with PaKS is provided to illustrate the output format:  
`300s-PaKS-i300_1.json`.

The summary file `PaKS_CompleteResults.xlsx` consolidates the main results reported in the manuscript, comparing PaKS and KS14 across a wide range of benchmark instances.
